Project: Dodger (2011)

This project is a game which I created for fun in my spare time.

The concept is simple:
- Avoid all moving blocks for as long as possible; the game ends when there is a collision
- Score is mainly calculated from time
- After set increments of time new blocks spawn at random locations
  - Different types of blocks (denoted by color) have different speed/shape/size
  - Most blocks simply bounce off of the outer walls
  - One type of block follows the player (this prevents the player from "camping")
- After set increments of time collectable tokens spawn at random locations
  - Some tokens award extra score
  - Some tokens freeze all blocks on the screen for a short period of time
  - Some tokens make the player invincible for a short period of time
  
I may remake/improve this game in the future.
